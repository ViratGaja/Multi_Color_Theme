A dynamic and responsive React-based web app with a multi-theme switcher. This application lets users switch between **three distinct themes** — each with unique layout structures, fonts, and color schemes. Built using **Vite + React + TypeScript**, and styled using custom CSS with localStorage-based theme persistence.
